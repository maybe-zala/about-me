  <center><h3 class="heading">My Past</h3></center>
    <p class="text">Born and raised in Memphis, Tennesee, I was an only child until the age of 8. I had a very humble childhood with a lot of unique challenges that I believe shaped me into the compassionate and driven person I am today. I have 6 siblings in total, with one being, my adopted cousin. I changed schools a lot before finally staying at Pleasant Hill elementary, and continuing my education until I graduated from Desoto Central High May 20th, 2025.</p>

  <center><h3 class="heading">My Present</h3></center>
    <p class="text">I currently attend Basecamp Coding Academy where I'm earning my associates in programming while learning to be a full-stack developer. I will then continue to earn my bachelor's and hopefully find a well-paying job that will allow me to showcase my skills.</p>

  <center><h3 class="heading">My Future</h3></center>
    <p class="text">After getting my bachelor's, I will move up north and hopefully attend an ivy league law school to earn my J.D. in criminal and family law. In my second year of law school I will work as a police officer during the day and take classes at night, to ensure I can pay for my education. </p>
